## Motivation

Fake news spreads rapidly through social media and online platforms, impacting public opinion and trust. Automating the detection of misleading or false content can help mitigate misinformation. This project aims to build a model that classifies news as **real** or **fake**, using text analysis techniques and machine learning.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, vectorization  
- Feature engineering / representation (e.g. TF-IDF, embeddings)  
- Model training and validation  
- Metric evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)  
- Exploration via Jupyter notebook  
- Easy-to-follow pipeline for experimentation

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone** the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/aaradhy25tiwari/Fake-News-Detector.git
        cd Fake-News-Detector

## Usage

1. Open detector.ipynb in Jupyter / JupyterLab / Colab.

2. Walk through each cell:

    - Load and inspect the dataset

    - Preprocess text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

    - Transform text into feature vectors (e.g. TF-IDF)

    - Train one or more classifiers (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)

    - Evaluate performance on validation/test data

    - Visualize results (confusion matrix, feature importances, etc.)

You may also fork cells / create new scripts by modularizing the steps.

## Methodology & Workflow

Here‚Äôs the typical pipeline adopted in the notebook:

1. Data Loading & Exploration  
Read the news data, check distribution of labels (real vs fake), explore sample texts.

2. Text Preprocessing

    - Lowercasing

    - Removing punctuation, HTML tags, special characters

    - Tokenization

    - Stopword removal

    - (Optional) Lemmatization / stemming

3. Feature Engineering / Representation

    - Bag-of-words / TF-IDF

    - n-grams

    - (Optional) Word embeddings or transformer embeddings

4. Model Training  
Train one or more classifiers (e.g. Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM).
Use cross-validation or hold-out validation to pick hyperparameters.

5. Evaluation  
Compute metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Optionally, show confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.

6. Analysis & Interpretation

    - Examine which features (words) are most discriminative

    - Inspect misclassified examples

    - Discuss strengths / weaknesses

## Evaluation & Results

In the notebook, you'll find performance results such as:

- Comparison of multiple classifiers

- Metric scores (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)

- Confusion matrices
